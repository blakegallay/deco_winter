Files and directories:

/irradiation: Hillas parameters csvs and histograms from the irradiation experiment

/simulation-original: results from simulation images with no brightness threshold applied

/simulation-threshold: results from simulation images with a brightness threshold of 50 (~electrons) applied

/deco: Spots and Tracks from DECO data

/plots: plots

sample.csv: refined and weighted sample of simulation events

weight_samples.py: generated sample.csv, uses cos^3(theta) weighting from the threshold simulation results

hists/hists2.py: make the histograms in ./plots (almost the same file, just for my personal discretion)

fix.py: adds CNN data into spreadsheets that come back from the Cobalts without it, used because CNN probabilities stay relatively constant between modifications to my image analysis algorithms, we mostly change how Hillas parameters are calculated. Since classification supplies the largest overhead, we just re-calculate Hillas parameters on the Cobalts and then inject the same CNN data back into the csvs locally. Bad pipeline? Definitely.

classification_hists.ipynb: makes histograms of CNN probabilities for simulation events
